## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.5] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- **Client A-ASSOCIATE-AC parser now detects rejected presentation contexts.**
  `receiveAssociateAC()` read the Result/Reason from the wrong byte (offset+7, a
  reserved byte that is always 0x00) instead of offset+6 per PS3.8 Table 9-18, so
  every context was marked `Accepted`. The SCU could then send C-STORE data on a
  presentation context / transfer syntax the SCP had rejected, causing the peer
  to abort mid-transfer ("connection reset by peer"). Rejected contexts are now
  left `Accepted = false` with an empty `TransferSyntax`, and each is logged at
  WARN with its context id, abstract syntax, and numeric reason code.
- **Client now honors the SCP's Maximum PDU Length from the A-ASSOCIATE-AC.**
  The AC item loop ignored the User Information item (0x50) / Maximum Length
  sub-item (0x51), so `maxPDULength` stayed at the configured default (16384)
  regardless of what the SCP announced. P-DATA-TF chunking then produced oversized
  PDUs that a smaller-max SCP would reset on. The client now parses 0x50/0x51 and
  sets `maxPDULength = min(configured, peer)`, treating a peer value of 0 as
  "unlimited" (keeps the configured value).
- **A-ASSOCIATE-AC writer wire format corrected.** `createAssociateAccept()` put
  the Result/Reason byte at sub-field offset 1 (reserved) instead of offset 2.
  Now emitted as `context ID, 0x00, Result, 0x00` per PS3.8, keeping
  dicomnet<->dicomnet interop while conforming to the standard.
- **A-ASSOCIATE-AC writer no longer hardcodes the Maximum PDU Length**; it uses
  the association's negotiated `MaxPDULength`.

### Changed
- `pdu.parseUserInformation` is now exported as `pdu.ParseUserInformation`.

### Testing
- Table tests for `receiveAssociateAC` covering all-accepted, mixed
  accepted/rejected (reasons 3 and 4), and Maximum Length negotiation
  (smaller / unlimited / larger peer values).
- Round-trip test: the client builds an A-ASSOCIATE-RQ, the server negotiates and
  writes the A-ASSOCIATE-AC via its real writer, and the client parses it back —
  guarding the writer and parser against drifting apart.
- `pdu` wire-format test asserting the Result byte position and the announced
  Maximum Length in `createAssociateAccept()`.
